## Inspiration: 
From former experience in hackathons and similar environmental engineering projects, we came up with this innovative design within the time frame given. We seemed to have a solid piece to turn in and take with us after the hackathon.

## What it does
Please watch longer video for full descriptions. 

## How we built it
Briefly stating, we used python, flask, and HTML/CSS. However, we also have a Blender 3D CAD model to show. Lastly, we have a bio-chem-physics analysis to view a scenario in our longer video. 

## Challenges we ran into
Time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The longer video version.

## What we learned
How to make a good impact in a short amount of time.

## What's next for Climate Cycle IRE 
Submission for a fellowship or grant for further advancement for anybody interested. We will keep and post our project in LinkedIn as it is a good professional development and experience for all of our members.
