 1) How do you describe your business/yourself?
Our business focuses on generating electrical energy from natural H2O from precipitation and snow to create a stronger adaptation to climate change, concurrently avoiding some financial recoil that would normally be taken to produce the electrical power gained by our system. Using concepts of hydroelectric power, our renewable energy can provide the user with 100 Watts of electricity for every 300 Joules of harvested potential energy from natural water runoff.

2) What is the primary goal of your website?
The primary goal of our website is to increase awareness of our technology for public and private commercial consulting in order to convince clients to implement our Renewable Energy System using Hydropower. The website displays information regarding the contents of the technology that can be available to consumers upon installation in their houses. 
We are assuming customers may have problems with access to water and/or electrical energy in this hard economy world and climate change and could benefit from an implementation of our commercial renewable energy system. Nevertheless, our system can be implemented by several other customers that may have an interest in saving financial assets that correspond to daily electrical and water needs. From the implementation of this technology, we can provide more services to help customers save financial assets regarding daily electrical maintenance (e.g. lighting, heating, water irrigation).  

3) What problem do you want to solve with this design?
There are several problems that our renewable energy system can introduce solutions and or relief to the problems of our product consumers. These includes, but is not limited to the following potential problem(s):
The problem of not having enough financial resources to access water from the usual water distribution networks available to households by their fellow government.
The implementation of our system will allow a “cut off” of services that would normally require financial assets to bring, such as paying for electrical services. 

The problem of being negatively impacted by hazards due to climate changes, such as house isolation from heavy snow storm buildup or floods due to heavy rain storms.
In the case of snow: The snow that would accumulate in houses could be melted with our system’s thermal components and defrosted to liquid water solution for storage and future use. 
In the case of heavy storms, a percentage of water that would normally start to flood into public drainage would be collected and stored for each household with our device and used by the house members in the near future.

The problem of lack of access to electricity in households that would normally be necessary for daily uses (e.g. lighting, electric stove/ovens, phone or other essential electrical appliances).

The problem of increasing daily food supplies at commercial premises.
